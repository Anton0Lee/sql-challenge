# sql-challenge
Data Analytics Bootcamp Challenge 9  
This repo contains a data folder for all the csv files,  
the query sql codes, the table schemata sql codes,  
the ERD image, and a python script for formating the date data from one of the csv file.  

The python script is required as the date formating was not recognised by the pgadmin sql, thus requries it to be reformatted.  
In the data folder, the old csv file (incorrect date format) is saved as 'old'. 

This task requires mainly the use of joining tables.  
The most difficult part would be setting up the tables with correct relationships and data formats.  
The part where I needed to reformat the dates took a long time as I was not familiar with the use of datetime funciton in python. 
Tips: It would be easier if I create the ERD image first then use it to generate the sql codes to create the tables.
